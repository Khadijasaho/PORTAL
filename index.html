       <p>Hello my name is Khadija Saho, I’m an Emerging professional who was born and raised in Seattle and I’m African-American Muslim women; currently studying Application Development at Year UP. Learning HTTP, CSS, Python and many more computer languages.

       <p>I have over 5 years of experience in Customer Service and Sales in both the Restaurant and Automotive industry. I am working on building up my programming and business communication skills. In the near future I’ll be working toward being part of a tech company where I can seek out growth opportunities that also align with my values.</p>
       
       <p>I enjoy watching documentaries in my spare time and going on long walks in the morning to clear my mind . I also played volleyball, basketball as a shooter and joined Track & Field as a sprinter and javelin player during high school.
    </p>
           
      <p>Year up has been one of the biggest commitments . I have had since high school, by making sure I attend all my classes on time to dress professionally, keeping a positive line of communication with the Year up staff and my instructors.</p>

      <p>Within the next couple of months, I’m very much looking forward to achieving the goals I have set during my time at Year UP and in the near future. I know With  self advocacy, commitment and consistency I am 100% certain that I will be able to uphold the title as True Professional .</p>
